# Karen-Bot

This is a bot that utilizes the discord API. I made this bot as one of my first ever projects in Python to learn the language. 
What this bot does is if you use a command !karenhelp, it will print out the commands for the bot.
It will also say random phrases if you say certain words too, and will print an array of images from my directory on images of ZOC Idols
